Hashtables
In Little Search Engine I worked with HashTables, wherein it takes words out of at most 5 text files, loads every word and its frequency in a HashTable (not the noiseWords) and finds the files in which the user inputted word appears and lists it in descending order of frequencies.

In this project I have made the driver and in LittleSearchEngine.java - 
loadKeywords()
mergeKeywords()
getKeyWord()
insertLastOccurrence()
top5Search()
