Binarytrees
This program takes set of intervals from the test file and makes a tree, and maps intervals to it. Later takes user input to find intersecting intervals in the tree.

In this I have worked on: IntervalTree.java-
sortIntervals()
getSortedEndpoints()
buildTreeNodes()
mapIntervalstoTree()
findIntersecting()
